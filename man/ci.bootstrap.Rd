\title{Approximate Bootstrap Confidence Interval (ABC)}
\usage{
ci.bootstrap(x, w, level, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of counts}

\item{w}{a vector of weights}

\item{level}{the level of confidence}

\item{...}{currently ignored}
}
\value{
a vector with the lower and upper bound of the confidence interval.
The estimate of the directly standardised rate and the level of confidence are
returned as attributes to this vector
